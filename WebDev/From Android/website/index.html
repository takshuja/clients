    <div class="intro">
        Hello Everyone, I am Tash and I am here to teach you basics of programming and later we will look into some
        programming languages like C, C++ and Python.
    </div>

    <div class="basics">
        <br>
        Lets take a look at the basics now.<br><br><u>What is Programming?</u><br><br>Programming is a <b>way to talk to
            the computer</b> or if we wanna be more precise, it means to <b>Instruct the computer to perform a specific
            task.</b>
        <br><br>
        Let's say you need a computer to check if a number is less than the other. We will tell the computer the
        following instructions:
        <ol>
            Ask the user to enter a number store it in a variable.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Ask the user to enter another number and also store it in another variable.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Compare the two numbers.
        </ol>
        <ol>
            Tell the user the end result.
        </ol>

        <br>In the above statement, we told the computer to perform a specific instruction for us or in other words, we
        "programmed" the computer to perform a specific task. But, here comes our first problem. Niether we understand
        the language of computers that is 0 and 1 nor the computer knows anything about human languages. So, in order to
        overcome this problem, we created some special languages to communicate with the computers known as "programming
        languages".
        <br><br>
        Some of the commonly used programming languages are: Python, C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Golang, Rust, Javascript, C#
        and many more.
        <p>
            <u>Types of programming languages:</u><br><br>
            <b>1. Low Level Languages: </b> The programming languages that are very close to writing actual machine
            instructions. These are often known as computers native languages and they are machine dependent
            languages.<br>Some examples of low level languages are: ASM and machine code.
            <br><br>
            <b>2. Mid Level Languages: </b> These programming languages are close to machine as well as human readable.
            They are much easier to learn than low level programming languages.<br>Some examples of mid level
            programming languages are: C, C++, Java.
            <br><br>
            <b>3. High Level Languages: </b> These programming languages are much closer(more human readable) to humans
            than machines. These languages are the easiest to learn and debug. <br> Some examples of high level
            languages are: Python, Perl, Ruby, C#, ...

            <b><u>Now, lets dive into some basic concepts of programming.</u></b><br><br>
            <b>1. Variables: </b>Variables are one of the basic and most important building blocks of any program. Variables are names which we give to computer memory locations to store data. We can think of variables as containers to store some form of data. When we declare a variable, we tell the computer to store a value into a computer memory address so we can access it later. <br>
